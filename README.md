My solutions to projecteuler.net problems.

I took these problems as a way to explore the ruby programming language while learning it, so mostly my focus was on employing certain ruby features or idioms more than on finding an optimal solution from a mathematical perspective.

Sharing in case it could be useful for any ruby learner. Anything I may help just contact me at mafraba@gmail.com.
